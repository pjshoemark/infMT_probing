1199	daily card discussion march 28 2018: dark prince  seeing 40% usage rate in grand challenges, dark prince was very clearly overbuffed. getting 20 wins on the league challenge took four dark prince counters (bandit, royal ghost, hunter, zappies) and four 3m counters (with some overlap, obviously), and while needing several 3m counters isn’t a surprise in the slightest in any meta, i think it’s worth mentioning that despite being nearly guaranteed a dark prince counter in my hand at all times was not enough to prevent him from getting value. if half of someone’s deck counters a card in yours, one would expect that you would be unable to use it in that matchup much, but dark prince breaks that rule. dark prince is simply too strong.  i would propose that his hitspeed is reverted to 1.4 seconds.	日々 の カード 討論 　 2018 年 3 月 18 日 ： グランド チャレンジ で 40 ％ の 使用 率 を 見 た ダーク プリンス は 、 はっきり と オーバーバフ し て い ま し た 。 リーグ の 挑戦 で 20 勝 を 達成 する に は 、 4 の ダーク プリンス カウンター （ bandit 、 royal 　 ghost 、 hunter 、 zappies ） と 4 の 3 m カウンター が 必要 で し た （ 明らか に いく つ か の オーバーラップ が あ り ま す ） 、 3 m の カウンター を いく つ か 必要 と し て い る の は メタ の 中 で 少し で も 驚き で は あ り ま せ ん が 、 ダーク プリンス カウンター が いつ も 安心 し て い る に も かかわ ら ず 、 <<<彼>>>_3 の 価値 を 妨げ る の に 十分 で は な かっ た と 言え る で しょ う 。 誰 か の デッキ の 半数 が 自分 の カード に カウンター を 1 枚 使用 し た 場合 、 <<<あなた>>>_2 は その マッチ アップ で それ を 使用 する こと が でき な い と 思 う で しょ う が 、 ダーク プリンス は その ルール を 破 り ま す 。 ダーク プリンス は 単に 強 すぎ ま す 。 　 <<<私>>>_1 は ヒット スピード が 1 . 4 秒 に 戻 っ て くる こと を 提案 し ま す 。	you:1	<<<あなた>>>_2:1	0

1778	grandfather took nazi flag from building in naples 1943  i agree with vegipaddy. museums (and archives, tho i wouldn’t recommend them in this case) love when individuals have historical items have the research/stories attached to them.  with that said, if this is a route you plan on exploring, i would pause on framing or encasing any other items. museums often have to take specific steps to preserve items before they are encased and displayed so they might undue the hard work you put in. also, many museums keep much of their holdings in storage, so i would ask critical questions about this process to the curator.   if you plan on personally keeping this item and others like it, the time and attention of framing is a wonderful preservation tool. and i think a plaque is also a stellar idea.	祖父 は 1943 年 ナポリ に あ る ビル から 、 ナチス の 旗 を 取 っ て き た 。 vegipaddy に 賛成 。 博物 館 （ あと 公 文書 保管 所 も 。 この 場合 は お 勧め し な い けど ） は 、 歴史 的 アイテム を 所有 し て い たり 、 歴史 研究 や 実話 に 詳し い 人々 を 歓迎 する 。 もし こう い う 道 を 探求 し た い なら 、 <<<僕>>>_1 だっ た ら 、 アイテム を 額 に 入れ たり 包 ん だり する こと は やめ る よ 。 博物 館 で は 、 アイテム を 額 に 入れ て 展示 する 前 に 、 特別 な 保存 手段 を 取 ら な けれ ば いけ な い から 、 <<<きみ>>>_2 の 努力 が 無駄 に な っ ちゃ う か も しれ な い ん だ 。 それ に 、 多く の 博物 館 で は 貯蔵 物 の ほとんど を 倉庫 で 保管 し て い る から 、 <<<僕>>>_1 は この 行程 に つ い て 学芸 員 に 厳し い 質問 を し て しま う けど ね 。 もし <<<きみ>>>_2 が この アイテム を 個人 的 に 保管 する つもり なら 、 額 に 入れ る 手間 と 時間 こそ が 最高 の 保存 方法 だ ね 。 あと 、 飾り 額 も すばらし い アイディア だ と 思 う よ 。	you:3	0	S

3009	how f*cked am i if i want to be an mma fighter?  you don’t have to be a “master of the craft” to have a job. in fact, you’re not expected to be a “master” at any job you start, even ones that require extensive schooling. there’s a reason why the term “entry-level” exists. and you don’t become a master by naturally having talent but by putting the work and learning from experience. also, like i said, you have no idea of what the range of possible careers are. most jobs have duties that don’t fit in a neat box and just involves different mundane activities.   trust me, you don’t want to live in poverty. it fucking sucks living on just noodles and eggs for weeks on end. it fucking sucks to worry about if you even enough money to make it to a job. it fucking sucks trying to stretch 20 bucks over a week. it fucking sucks to lie in your closet called a room, with no mattress because you can’t afford one, in the middle of summer with no air conditioning.	もし 、 mma ファイター に な り た い と し た ら 、 <<<俺>>>_1 って どん だけ 狂 っ て る ん だ ？ 仕事 を 手 に 入れ る ため だ から って 、 巧み な 技術 を 身 に つけ る 必要 なんて な い ん だ よ 。 実際 に 、 仕事 を 始め た 時 に <<<お前>>>_2 が 完璧 だ なんて 誰 も 予想 し て な い よ 。 それ が 、 たとえ 厳し い 訓練 な もの で も 。 エントリー レベル って の が あ る 理由 っ て の が あ る の さ 。 そして 、 才能 が あ っ て 、 自然 と 完璧 に な る って わけ で も な く て 、 経験 から 学 ん で 上達 し て い く ん だ 。 あと 、 前述 し た よう に 、 <<<君>>>_2 は どんな 仕事 が でき る か って の は 想像 も でき て な い よ 。 ほとんど の 仕事 に は 義務 っ て の が あ っ て 、 それ は 何 か 簡単 に 説明 でき る もん じゃ な く て 、 いろんな つま ら な い 活動 も 含 ま れ て る ん だ 。 本当 に 、 貧し く くら し た く な い だ ろ 。 ずーっと 、 卵 と ヌードル 食べ て 暮ら す なんて 、 本当 に 最悪 だ ぜ 。 通勤 する ため の お 金 の 心配 まで する なんて の も 最悪 だ し 。 たった 20 ドル で 1 週間 暮ら そ う と する の も 最悪 だ し 。 部屋 っ て 呼 ん で る その クローゼット の 中 で 、 買え な い から マットレス も な く 寝 る の も 最悪 だ し 。 真夏 に エアコン も な い の も さ 。	you:8	<<<お前>>>_2:1 <<<君>>>_2:1	S

1297	i'm looking for unusual or esoteric dice systems in tabletop rpgs.  fanatasy flight star wars has the weirdest dice system i’ve ever seen.  if you have 5 points in shooting and 2 in the attribute your dm wants you to use you roll 3d6 and 2d12 (using the yellow and purple dice which are beneficial) if the dm decides that the difficulty is 2 you also roll 2d6 (red this time for a negative) if it’s really hard there’s a black d12 also that can be rolled instead of a d6.  then you count up all the symbols on the dice (because they use symbols and not numbers) and if you have more blasts than skulls overall you succeed. unless you get two skulls on a dice in which case you always miss.  there’s a reason that, in a group that plays almost every system we’ve had zero desire to go back to ff after a few weeks of playing it.	テーブル トップ rpg で 、 珍し い 、 あるいは 難解 な ダイス システム を 探 し て い ま す 。 　 ファンタジー フライト スター ウォーズ は 、 <<<私>>>_1 が 今 まで 見 た こと の な い 奇妙 な サイコロ システム を 備え て い ま す 。 射撃 時 に 5 点 、 属性 に 2 点 あ る 場合 、 dm は <<<あなた>>>_2 に 3 d 6 と 2 d 12 （ 有益 な 黄色 と 紫 の サイコロ を 使 い ま す ） を 使 っ て もら う こと を 望 み ま す 。 dm が 難易 度 2 と 判断 し た 場合 、 2 d 6 も 転が し ま す （ マイナス な の で 、 今回 は 赤 で す ） 本当 に 難し い 場合 に は 、 　 d 6 の 代わり に 黒 の d 12 を 転が す こと が 出来 ま す 。 　 それ から 、 ダイス 上 の すべて の シンボル （ 数字 で は な く 、 シンボル が 使 わ れ て い る ため ） を 数え 、 全体 的 に ガイコツ より も 爆発 シンボル の 方 が 多 けれ ば 、 それ は 成功 で す 。 <<<あなた>>>_2 が ダイス で 2 つ の ガイコツ を 手 に 入れ た 場合 、 それ は 常 に ミス し て い る と い う こと で す 。 　 ほとんど すべて の システム を プレイ する グループ で は 、 それ を 数 週間 プレイ し て しま う と 、 ff に 戻 り た い と い う 願望 が 一切 な く な る と い う 理由 が あ り ま す 。	you:9	<<<あなた>>>_2:2	S

1796	new legendary card: "lord godfrey"  for any class besides paladin i’d agre.  but paladin, because (a) divine favor and (b) huge synergy with a built board may get a lot of value from blocking a board clear before a big swing turn.  so for paksfun aggro i can see it going either way.  **but** there’re paladin decks besides aggro.  i’m having a lot of success with lynessa exodia.  and while that deck won’t quite exist without some very specific help a card like this could help for sure.

4078	questions for deadmau5 for h3 podcast thursday march 29th at 3pm pst  damn... i didn't realize aoki only played pre recorded sets.  i knew he used ghost producers and had better cake throwing skills than actual dj skills but i didn't realize it was that bad.  i think most edm djs do live sets but maybe i'm just naive.  however i recently stumbled upon videos calling laidback luke and martin garrix out for "pretending to touch knobs" but if you actually watch the videos they are just kind of checking knobs or sort of touching them without really doing anything which to be honest i catch myself doing subconsciously, probably because it feels "natural".  (but i can say with 100% certainty that laidback luke and martin garrix dj live)  i know dvbbs and david guetta have been caught playing pre recorded sets but at the same time i'm pretty sure they do live sets as well (which is no exceuse imo).	deadmau 5 　 の 　 h 3 　 に 対 する 質問 \\ \\ n ポッド キャスト ３ 月 ２９ 日 木曜 日 　 3 pm 　 太平 洋 標準 時 　 う〜ん 、 青木 が 録音 済み の セット だけ で 演奏 し て た こと は 知 ら な かっ た 。 ゴースト プロデューサー を 使 っ て dj の スキル より も ケーキ を 投げ る スキル の 方 が 上手 い って 事 は 知 っ て い た けれど 、 そこ まで 酷 い と は 知 ら な かっ た 。 \\\\n\\\\ n 殆ど の edm の dj 達 は ライブ 設定 で や っ て い る と 考え る けれど 、 ナイーブ な だけ か な 。 しかし 、 最近 　 laidback 　 luke と martin 　 garrix の ビデオ を 見つけ た 。 ビデオ を よく 見 て もら う と わか る よう に 、 ノブ を チェック し て 触 っ て い る よう に 見え る が 、 実際 に は 何 も し て い な い よう で 、 正直 言 う と 自然 な 感覚 で 自分 で も よく や っ て い る 事 だ 。 （ しかし 100 ％ 確か に laidback 　 luke と martin 　 garrix 　 dj は ライブ で や っ て る ） dv bbs と david 　 guetta は 録音 済み の セット で や っ て る ところ を 見つか っ た みたい だ けれど 、 で も また 同時 に ライブ 設定 で や っ て い る 事 も 間違い な い と 思 う 。 （ 個人 的 な 意見 だ けれど 、 それ は 言い分け に な ら な い よ 。 ）	you:1	0	S
